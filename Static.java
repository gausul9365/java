Things to Remember

Access Through Class Name:
Use ClassName.variable to emphasize that the variable belongs to the class. --> jaise line 23 me hua h 

Initialization Happens Once:
Static variables are initialized only once, when the class is loaded into memory.

Shared State:
Be careful when modifying static variables, as changes will affect all instances.

      Constant Values: Itâ€™s mainly used to define constants that should not be changed and need to be shared by all instances of the class. A good example is mathematical constants like PI.
