The protected access modifier is accessible within the package. However, it can also accessible outside the package but through inheritance only.
We can't assign protected to outer class and interface.
If you make any constructor protected, you cannot create the instance of that class from outside the package.
If you are overriding any method, overridden method (i.e., declared in the subclass) must not be more restrictive.
According to the previous point, if you assign protected to any method or variable, that method or variable can be overridden to sub-class using public or protected access modifier only.
